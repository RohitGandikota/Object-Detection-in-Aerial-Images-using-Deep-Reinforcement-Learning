# Object-Detection-in-Aerial-Images-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project harnesses deep reinforcement learning to detect cars in aerial images

Object detection in aerial/satellite images is a challenging task compared to real world images for 2 reasons. First, the ratio of object size to the image size is very small (almost 1/2000 pixels) making it difficult for one-shot object detectors like YoLO-V3 to make accurate detection. Second, the computational capacity to  search in a large image space as most satellite images come in the size $>$5000 pixels. This makes the object detection task for R-CNNs and other region based proposal methods very computationally complex and less accurate in satellite image domain. We propose a spatio-resolution deep reinforcement learning agent to detect objects in hierarchical fashion, both in resolution and spatial domain. The proposed method takes context from a spatial context from a pre-trained semantic segmentation network as state from a lower resolution satellite image and predicts the region of the image in which the object is present. The agent then considers the region in higher-resolutions to hierarchically detect the object.
